 <a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>  Logarithmically-spaced frequencies for generalized Morse wavelets.
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,N) generates a frequency array for the 
    generalized Morse wavelet transform of an N-point time series. The 
    wavelets are specified by GAMMA and BETA.  
 
    LOG(F) is uniformly spaced, following convention for wavelet analysis.
 
    F has units of *radians* per sample point, and is a column vector with 
    the frequencies arranged in decending order. 
    
    In this usage, the frequencies F are determined using default settings,
    described below, which should be appropriate for most applications.  
 
    Additional control over the frequency array F can be obtained using the
    following alternate usages.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    High- and low-frequency specification
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,HIGH,LOW) explicitly sets the high-frequency
    and low-frequency cutoffs for the frequency array.  
 
    The first (largest) value of F is then just smaller than HIGH and the 
    smallest is just larger than LOW.
 
    HIGH and LOW have units of *radian* per unit sample point.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    High-frequency cutoff
 
    The highest frequency can be set to be the minimum of a specified value
    and a cutoff frequency based on a Nyquist overlap condition.
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,{ALPHA,HIGH},LOW) sets the highest frequency 
    to be the minimum of the specified value HIGH, and the largest 
    frequency for which the wavelet will satisfy the threshold level ALPHA. 
 
    Here ALPHA be a number between zero and one specifying the ratio of a
    frequency-domain wavelet at the Nyquist frequency to its peak value.
 
    Note that in this usage, {ALPHA,HIGH} is a cell array with two entries.
 
    The simplified usage F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,N) corresponds to the 
    choice ALPHA=0.1, so that by default, the highest-frequency wavelet 
    will decay to at least 10% of its peak value at the Nyquist frequency.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Low-frequency cutoff
 
    The lowest frequency can be set to a cutoff frequency based on an 
    endpoint overlap condition.
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,HIGH,{R,N}) sets the lowest frequency such that
    the lowest-frequency wavelet will reach R times its central window
    width at the ends of the time series. 
   
    A choice of R=SQRT(2) corresponds to roughly 95% of the time-domain 
    wavelet energy being contained within the time series endpoints for a
    wavelet at the center of the domain.
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,HIGH,{R,N,LOW}) alternately chooses the maximum 
    of the R-level cutoff frequency, and a specified low frequency LOW.
    
    The simplified usage F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,N) corresponds to the
    default value R=5*SQRT(2).  At the lowest frequency, five wavelets will
    then fit into the time series, with 5% energy overlap between them.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Wavelet density
 
    F=<a href="morsespace.html">MORSESPACE</a>(GAMMA,BETA,HIGH,LOW,D) controls the number of points in 
    the frequency array through the 'density' D. 
 
    Higher values of D mean more overlap in the frequency domain. The
    default value of the density is D=4.
 
    When D=1, the peak of one wavelet is located at the half-power points 
    of the adjacent wavelet. D=4 means that four other wavelets will occur 
    between the peak of one wavelet and its half-power point.
