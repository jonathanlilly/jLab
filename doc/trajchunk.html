 <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>  Converts Lagrangian trajectories into chunks based on the Coriolis period.
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> is used to split float or drifter data into chuncks such that
    the length of each chunk is a fixed multiple of the average Coriolis
    frequency. This is useful in spectral analysis. 
 
    [NUMO,LATO]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,P), where NUM and LAT are date number and
    latitude for Lagangian float or drifter data, re-organizes these into 
    chunks such that the average Coriolis frequency f_C in each chunk is at 
    least P times the Rayleigh frequency f_R for that chunk.
 
    Recall that the Rayleigh frequency is f_R=2*pi/(DT*N), in units of 
    radians per unit time, where DT is the sample interval and N is the
    number of samples.
 
    The input fields NUM and LAT may either be numerical arrays, or 
    cell arrays of numerical arrays, e.g. NUM{1}=NUM1, NUM{2}=NUM2, etc.
 
    The output variables NUM and LAT are now cell arrays of numerical
    arrays, with each cell is truncated such that its length is just long
    enough such that f_C > P * f_R.  
 
    Trajectories that are not long enough to satisfy this criterion are 
    discarded, as are short residual segments at the end of trajectories.   
 
    Each input trajectory is thus split into zero, one, or more than one
    cells in the output variables.     
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,P,LMIN) additionally specifies a mininum number of points
    LMIN for each chunk.

    Multiple input arguments
 
    [NUMO,LATO,Y1,Y2,...,YM]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,X1,X2,...XM,N) chunks the M
    input arrays X1, X2,... XM in the same manner, and returns these as Y1,
    Y2,... YM.  The input variables may either all be numerical arrays of 
    all the same size, or cell arrays of numerical arrays. 
 
    In the case of cell array input, some of the XM may be numerical arrays
    of the same length as the cells NUM and LAT.  The corresponding output 
    variable will then also be a numerical array.  An example of such a
    field is the identification number used in FLOATS.MAT and DRIFTERS.MAT. 
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> with no output arguments overwrites the original named output
    variables.

    Keeping short data segments
 
    By default, any data is cells shorter than the specified length are 
    discarded, as are data segments at the end of the trajectories.  
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'keep') keeps these instead.  Short cells are returned in
    their own chunks, and leftover segments are appended to the end of the 
    preceding chunk.  
 
    This preserves the number of data points, while favoring a requested 
    length, if possible, from each trajectory. 
    __________________________________________________________________
    
    Overlap
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',PCT) outputs chunks with a percentage PCT 
    overlap.  For example, <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',50) outputs chunks that 
    overlap by 50%.  The default behavior gives chunks with no overlap.

    '<a href="trajchunk.html">trajchunk</a> --t' runs a test.
 
    Usage: [num,lat]=<a href="trajchunk.html">trajchunk</a>(num,lat,P);
           [num,lat,lon,cv]=<a href="trajchunk.html">trajchunk</a>(num,lat,lon,cv,P);
           [num,lat,lon,cv]=<a href="trajchunk.html">trajchunk</a>(num,lat,lon,cv,P,lmin);
           [num,lat,lon,cv]=<a href="trajchunk.html">trajchunk</a>(num,lat,lon,cv,P,'overlap',50);
