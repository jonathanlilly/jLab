 <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>  Finds wavelet ridge points using one of several criterion.
 
    <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a> is a low-level function called by <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>.
   
    BOOL=<a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>(W,FS,CHI,STR) where W is a wavelet transform matrix  
    at *radian* frequecies FS, finds all ridge points of W with amplitudes
    |W| exceeding the amplitude cutoff A.  Several different different 
    ridge defintions may be used and are specified by STR.
 
    BOOL is a matrix of the same size as W, which is equal to one for 
    those elements of W which are ridge points, and zero otherwise.
 
    STR may be either of the following:
 
         'phase'       Rate of transform change of phase definition
         'amplitude'   Maxima of transfom amplitude definition
 
    For all definitions, <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a> rejects spurious ridge points.
    These tend to occur on the flanks of interesting signals, and 
    reflect the wavelet structure rather than the signal structure.
 
    A ridge point is considered spurious if either it is located at an
    amplitude minima, or if the frequency anomaly (transform frequency
    minus scale frequency) is a maximum.
 
    BOOL=<a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>(W,FS,CHI,STR,FMIN,FMAX) only returns ridge points
    between frequencies FMIN and FMAX, which may be either scalars or 
    arrays of length SIZE(W,1).
 
    BOOL=<a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>(W,FS,CHI,STR,FMIN,FMAX,MASK), where MASK is a boolean
    variable of the same size as W, only returns ridge points at locations
    at which MASK is true.
 
    [BOOL,RQ,W,OMEGA]=<a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>(...) also returns the ridge quantity RQ,
    the complex-valued joint wavelet transform W, and the transform's
    instantaneous frequency OMEGA, all of which are of the same size.

    Usage: [bool,rq,w,om]=<a href="isridgepoint.html">isridgepoint</a>(w,fs,chi,str);
           [bool,rq,w,om]=<a href="isridgepoint.html">isridgepoint</a>(w,fs,chi,str,fmin,fmax);
           [bool,rq,w,om]=<a href="isridgepoint.html">isridgepoint</a>(w,fs,chi,str,fmin,fmax,mask);
