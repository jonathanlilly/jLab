 <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>  Finds wavelet ridge points using one of several criterion.
 
    <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a> is a low-level function called by <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>.
   
    BOOL=<a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a>(W,FS,CHI,STR) where W is a wavelet transform matrix  
    at *radian* frequecies FS, finds all ridge points of W with amplitudes
    |W| exceeding the amplitude cutoff A.  Several different different 
    ridge defintions may be used and are specified by STR.
 
    BOOL is a matrix of the same size as W, which is equal to one for 
    those elements of W which are ridge points, and zero otherwise.
 
    STR may be either of the following:
 
         'phase'       Rate of transform change of phase definition
         'amplitude'   Maxima of transfom amplitude definition
 
    For all definitions, <a href="isridgepoint.html">ISRIDGEPOINT</a> rejects spurious ridge points.
    These tend to occur on the flanks of interesting signals, and 
    reflect the wavelet structure rather than the signal structure.
 
    A ridge point is considered spurious if either it is located at an
    amplitude minima, or if the frequency anomaly (transform frequency
    minus scale frequency) is a maximum.
