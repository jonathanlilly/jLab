  <a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>  FMINSEARCH, but with bound constraints by transformation. [By J. D'Errico]
 
  usage: x=<a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>(fun,x0)
  usage: x=<a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>(fun,x0,LB)
  usage: x=<a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>(fun,x0,LB,UB)

  usage: x=<a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>(fun,x0,LB,UB,options,p1,p2,...)
  usage: [x,fval,exitflag,output]=<a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a>(fun,x0,...)
  
  arguments:
   fun, x0, options - see the help for FMINSEARCH
 
   LB - lower bound vector or array, must be the same size as x0
 
        If no lower bounds exist for one of the variables, then
        supply -inf for that variable.
 
        If no lower bounds at all, then LB may be left empty.
 
        Variables may be fixed in value by setting the corresponding
        lower and upper bounds to exactly the same value.
 
   UB - upper bound vector or array, must be the same size as x0
 
        If no upper bounds exist for one of the variables, then
        supply +inf for that variable.
 
        If no upper bounds at all, then UB may be left empty.
 
        Variables may be fixed in value by setting the corresponding
        lower and upper bounds to exactly the same value.
 
  Notes:
 
   If options is supplied, then TolX will apply to the transformed
   variables. All other FMINSEARCH parameters should be unaffected.
 
   Variables which are constrained by both a lower and an upper
   bound will use a sin transformation. Those constrained by
   only a lower or an upper bound will use a quadratic
   transformation, and unconstrained variables will be left alone.
 
   Variables may be fixed by setting their respective bounds equal.
   In this case, the problem will be reduced in size for FMINSEARCH.
 
   The bounds are inclusive inequalities, which admit the
   boundary values themselves, but will not permit ANY function
   evaluations outside the bounds. These constraints are strictly
   followed.
 
   If your problem has an EXCLUSIVE (strict) constraint which will
   not admit evaluation at the bound itself, then you must provide
   a slightly offset bound. An example of this is a function which
   contains the log of one of its parameters. If you constrain the
   variable to have a lower bound of zero, then <a href="fminsearchbnd.html">FMINSEARCHBND</a> may
   try to evaluate the function exactly at zero.
 
 
  Example usage:
  rosen = @(x) (1-x(1)).^2 + 105*(x(2)-x(1).^2).^2;
 
  fminsearch(rosen,[3 3])     % unconstrained
  ans =
     1.0000    1.0000
 
  <a href="fminsearchbnd.html">fminsearchbnd</a>(rosen,[3 3],[2 2],[])     % constrained
  ans =
     2.0000    4.0000
 
  See test_main.m for other examples of use.
