 <a href="makefigs_gulfdrifters.html">MAKEFIGS_GULFDRIFTERS</a>  Make figures for Lilly and Perez-Brunius (2021a).
 
    This function makes all figures for the paper
 
    Lilly, J. M. and P. Perez-Brunius (2021a). A gridded surface current
        product for the Gulf of Mexico from consolidated  drifter
        measurements.  Earth System Science Data, 13: 645â€“669.
  
    To use this function, you'll need to download several datasets
 
    GulfDriftersOpen.nc       https://zenodo.org/record/3985917
    GulfFlowOneQuarter.nc     https://zenodo.org/record/3978794
    GulfFlowOneTwelfth.nc     https://zenodo.org/record/3978794
    drifter_monthlymeans.mat  https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/mean_velocity.php
 
    You'll need to edit this file to reflect your search paths, and you'll 
    need to have jLab installed.
 
    This file is provided for completeness.  Some of the figures are not 
    going to look the same as in the paper, because GulfDriftersOpen.nc is
    missing several proprietary datasets that are included in the figures 
    in the paper.  Also, one of the figures uses CMEMS altimetry that is 
    not redistributed here.
