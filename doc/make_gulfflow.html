 <a href="make_gulfflow.html">MAKE_GULFFLOW</a>  Create a gridded velocity dataset for the Gulf of Mexico.
 
    GULFFLOW is a dataset containing space/time gridded sea surface 
    velocities from all available surface drifter data from the Gulf of
    Mexico, as described in 
 
         Lilly, J. M. and P. Perez-Brunius (2021a). A gridded surface
             current product for the Gulf of Mexico from consolidated  
             drifter measurements.  Submitted to Earth Science System Data.
 
    The dataset is available at 
 
         Lilly, J. M. and P. Perez-Brunius (2021). GulfFlow: A gridded 
             surface current product for the Gulf of Mexico from 
             consolidated drifter measurements. [Data set]. Zenodo.

    This file creates the gridded drifter dataset from the consolidated 
    surface drifter datasets.  It is provided for completeness, although it 
    will not be possible for you to recreate it because you do not have
    access to the proprietary GulfDriftersAll.nc dataset is it based on.
 
    The code for conversion from Matlab files to NetCDF was written by
    Paula Garcia Carrillo of CICESE with minor changes by J. Lilly.
 
    Usage: make_gulfflow --create
