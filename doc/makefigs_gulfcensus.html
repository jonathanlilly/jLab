 <a href="makefigs_gulfcensus.html">MAKEFIGS_GULFCENSUS</a>  Make figures for Lilly and Perez-Brunius (2021b).
 
    This function makes all figures for the paper
 
    Lilly, J. M. and P. Perez-Brunius (2021b).  Extracting statistically 
        significant eddy signals from large Lagrangian datasets using 
        wavelet ridge analysis, with application to the Gulf of Mexico.
        Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics, 28: 181â€“212.
  
    To use this function, you'll need to download several datasets
 
    gomed.nc                  https://zenodo.org/record/3978803
    GulfDriftersOpen.nc       https://zenodo.org/record/3985916
    GulfFlowOneTwelfth.nc     https://zenodo.org/record/3978793
 
    You'll need to edit this file to reflect your search paths, and you'll 
    need to have jLab installed.
 
    The figures are not going to look the same as in the paper, because 
    GulfDriftersOpen.nc is missing several proprietary datasets that are 
    included in the figures in the paper.
