%JLAB_INSTALL  Instructions for installing JLAB.
%  
%   After unzipping, in your 'startup.m' file, you should put the lines:
% 
%          addpath /your/path/to/jlab
%          jlab_addpath
%
%   The second line adds all the JLAB subdirectories to your search path. 
%
%   If you have downloaded from GitHub or Mathworks, you will need to 
%   change the name of the top level directory to be 'jlab'.  
%  
%   Then please type 'jlab_runtests' at the Matlab command prompt and copy
%   and paste the output to me at jmlilly@psi.edu.
